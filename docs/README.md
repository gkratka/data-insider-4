## 🏗️ Project Status

**Current Phase**: MVP Phase 1 - Foundation Development
- ✅ Frontend foundation with React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui
- 🚧 Backend API development with FastAPI
- 🚧 LLM integration with Anthropic Claude
- ⏳ Data processing engine with pandas
- ⏳ File upload and validation system

## 🎨 Project Vision

The Data Intelligence Platform democratizes data analysis by combining conversational AI with powerful Python data science tools. Users can upload data files and perform complex operations through natural language queries, making advanced analytics accessible to everyone.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

**Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Backend**: FastAPI, Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
**LLM**: Anthropic Claude API  
**Infrastructure**: Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis  

## 📋 Key Features (Planned)

- **Natural Language Queries** - Transform plain English into data operations
- **Multi-File Processing** - Work with CSV, Excel, JSON, and Parquet files
- **Statistical Analysis** - Descriptive statistics, regression, classification, clustering
- **Interactive Chat** - Conversational interface with context awareness
- **Data Export** - Results in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- **Real-time Processing** - Background operations for large datasets
