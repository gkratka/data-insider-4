## ü§ñ Analyzing Data with AI

### Natural Language Queries

Simply type questions about your data in the chat interface. The AI understands context and can perform complex analysis.

#### Basic Analysis Examples

```
"Show me a summary of the sales data"
"What are the top 5 products by revenue?"
"Calculate the average customer age"
"How many orders were placed last month?"
```

#### Statistical Analysis Examples

```
"Perform a correlation analysis between price and sales"
"Run a regression analysis to predict sales based on marketing spend"
"Show me the distribution of customer ages"
"Test if there's a significant difference in performance between regions"
```

#### Data Manipulation Examples

```
"Filter the data to show only customers from California"
"Group the data by product category and sum the revenues"
"Create a new column calculating profit margin"
"Remove rows where the price is missing"
```

#### Visualization Examples

```
"Create a bar chart showing sales by month"
"Generate a scatter plot of price vs quantity sold"
"Show a heatmap of correlations between variables"
"Make a pie chart of market share by competitor"
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Data Preparation Tips

1. **Clean Your Data**: Remove obvious errors and inconsistencies before upload
2. **Meaningful Column Names**: Use descriptive names (e.g., "customer_age" not "col_1")
3. **Consistent Formats**: Keep date formats, number formats consistent within columns
4. **Document Your Data**: Add a description file explaining what each column represents

### Query Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic questions, then get more specific
2. **Be Specific**: "Show sales by month" is better than "show sales"
3. **Use Context**: Reference previous results: "Now show the same chart but for 2023"
4. **Ask Follow-ups**: "Why did sales drop in March?" after seeing a chart

### Performance Optimization

1. **File Size**: For very large files, consider sampling or splitting
2. **Complex Analysis**: Break complex questions into smaller steps
3. **Browser Performance**: Close unnecessary tabs for better performance
4. **Internet Connection**: Stable connection required for large file processing
